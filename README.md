# AdventOfCode2018
My solution for the project [AdventOfCode2018](http://adventofcode.com/) written in Python 3.7.

My aim is to have clean solutions with test cases for all days including the answer. All input shall be provided in the same format as the input from the website.

## Usage
Execute with `python run_tests.py`. The script is able to run a single day and/or a specific test case. Run the script with the -h flag to view all the options. A typical command is `python run_tests.py -d 01 -t ea` to run the test for the example in part_a for day 01. The script will detect and list slow tests that might be interesting to have its execution time improve.
